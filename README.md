Coding stuff here B) here you'll find code I write in Lua, Python, C, and C++.  

Hello, im blackstar, idk how you found yourself here but im planning on mastering all 4 of  the languages here before I get out of highschool.

current levels-

Near pro - Python.

Intermediate(medium) - Lua

Moving out of basics - C

just started basics - C++

Yeah so the only code you can expect to look good from me is python. Lua might be pretty nice, my C code is pretty much where it should be. 
as for C++... it will take me a while, as it is one of the hardest to learn low level languages.
